<h1 align="left"> Path To Python 🎯 </h1>

## A structured roadmap to learning and mastering Python! 

This repository is **my personal learning space**, created to track my entire Python journey in one place.

I am **documenting my daily progress**, with **notes, code, projects, and problem-solving exercises**, as I move through everything from Python **basics to advanced** topics like DSA, OOP, web development, and more. 

It's an organized record of all the knowledge I'm gaining, created gradually and entirely at my own speed.
